 * Conway's game of life is a zero player game created by British mathematician John Conway in 1970
 * The game simulates life by cells becoming alive or dying based on certain conditions
 * The conditions are as follows:
 *      A cell can come alive if there are exactly three neighbours that are alive
 *      A cell dies if
 *          - It has more than three neighbours (Overcrowding)
 *          - It has 0 - 1 neighbours (Loneliness)
